error: Integrity check failed for npm package: "@denotest/cjs-default-export@1.0.0". Unable to verify that the package
is the same as when the lockfile was generated.

This could be caused by:
  * the lock file may be corrupt
  * the source itself may be corrupt

Use "--lock-write" flag to regenerate the lockfile at "[WILDCARD]deno.lock".
